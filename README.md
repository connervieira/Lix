A Linux simulator for beginners to learn the basics of the command line without the overhead and complexity of a full OS

## Binaries
Work in progress
(macOS builds are planned)

## Features
### Realistic Commands
The commands you use in Lix are identical to those found in Ubuntu, one of the most common Linux distributions.

### Realistic Outputs
Just like the commands, the responses to them are very realistic as well. The responses have been copy and pasted directly from Ubuntu, and even have delays in certain places to simulate processing time.

### Lightweight
Lix has almost no over-head, and is exponentially lighter to run than a full Linux distribution.

### Libre
Lix is completely free to use, both free in monetary terms, as well as free as in freedom. Anyone is free to take a look at the code, and make any changes they want!

### Command Line
Lix isn't a third party program that runs in it's own app. Lix runs right in the command line, so the experience is nearly identitical to running full Linux.he "Round" button in the top corner!

### Appropriate Placeholders
Some commands, like 'shutdown', require a multithreaded process to complete. Since Lix is single threaded appropriate measures have been put in place to make sure commands like this fail in a descriptive way, that make it clear that a command like this would work in real Linux.
